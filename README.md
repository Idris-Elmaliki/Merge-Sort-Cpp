Repo Overview
=============

This repo contains the logic for **Merge Sort** in the syntax of *C++*. 

The *Merge Sort Algorithm* is a *recursive* sorting algorithm that uses *divide and conquer* to split the array into smaller sub-arrays.
There the Algorithm sorts each of those sub-arrays, and once sorted they get glued back together until it is fully sorted. 
It is quite a fascinating Alogorithm and is much faster than the Basic Sorts Algorithms!
With Merge Sort having a time complexity of O(nlogn).
